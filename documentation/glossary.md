# Glossary of aviation terms
*Openscope uses some terms specific to aviation, this glossary attempts to define them.*

## ILS
*abbr. of* Instrument Landing System

Runways may have an associated Instrument Landing System which provides arriving aircraft with approach alignment information. There are two independent components: the ''localizer'' which provides lateral guidance, and the ''glide slope'' which provides vertical guidance.

## Fix

A pre-defined point that describes an aircraft's current position. A fix can be an airport (`EGKK`), a waypoint (`WILLO`), or other points, such as a VOR station (`GWC`).

## Waypoint

A fix that is used to aid in navigation, defined in a flight plan or route. Waypoints are assigned a 5-letter code, such as `WILLO` and `ABTUM`.

## Flight Level
*abbr.* FL

A plane's altitude, in 100s of feet. For example, a plane at `FL350` is flying at 35,000ft.

## SID
*abbr. of* Standard Instrument Departure

An instrument procedure used to guide aircraft from a departure airport out of that airport's airspace.

## STAR
*abbr. of* Standard Terminal Arrival Route

An instrument procedure used to guide aircraft to an airport, the inverse of a SID.

## Instrument procedure

A charted series of instructions guiding aircraft along a specific path. This could be a series of headings to fly until passing certain altitudes, or a series of fixes to follow. Altitude and speed restrictions may often apply at certain points along the procedure as well. These are used by air traffic control to organize traffic on a large scale, and reduce the load on controllers under normal operations.

## Airspace

A pre-defined three-dimensional area where certain restrictions occur. For example, in Class A airspace, VFR aircraft are not permitted.

## VFR
*abbr. of* Visual Flight Rules

A set of flight rules under which aircraft may fly visually, rather than depending completely on flight instruments. Because visibility is obviously required, VFR is only permitted when the cloud ceiling is at least 1,000 feet above ground level, and the visbility at least 3 statute miles, as well as remaining clear of clouds. Under VFR, aircraft do not have a flight plan filed with air traffic control, and therefore they may fly wherever they want, provided that they are talking to the right controllers when entering airspace of an elevated classification. They can therefore choose to spin in circles, fly along rivers and highways, fly direct to their destination, or follow a route just like an IFR aircraft would.

## IFR
*abbr. of* Instrument Flight Rules

IFR aircraft **do** have instruments allowing them to navigate and land using ILS. IFR aircraft have flight plans that direct them to waypoints.

## Route

A set of waypoints that form a path to the destination. In openScope, the route is changed with the `route` and `reroute` commands.

## Crosswind

Wind blowing at an aircraft from the side. For example, for an aircraft flying north, crosswind is wind blowing west to east or vice versa. This can create dangerous landing conditions.

## Tailwind

Wind blowing at an aircraft from the tail. In a north-flying aircraft, this is wind from south to north.
