# KCHS- Charleston International Airport

## About CHS
Charleston International Airport (IATA: CHS, ICAO: KCHS, FAA LID: CHS) is a joint civil-military airport located in North Charleston, South Carolina, United States. The airport is operated by the Charleston County Aviation Authority under a joint-use agreement with Joint Base Charleston. It is South Carolina's busiest airport; in 2022 the airport served over 5.3 million passengers in its busiest year on record. The airport is located in North Charleston and is approximately 12 miles (19 km) northwest of downtown Charleston. The airport serves as a focus city for Breeze Airways. It is also home to the Boeing facility that assembles the 787 Dreamliner.

## Airspace
The CHS TRACON covers about 60nm from the Charleston Airport and from the surface to 10,000 feet.

## Procedures
Charleston uses SIDs (Standard Instrument Departures) and STARs (Standard Terminal Arrival).


## Charleston SIDs
Charleston uses RNAV departures, which means aircraft following the departure from the runway. 
This means that departures only need to be climbed to 10000 (Charleston TRACON ceiling), and should only be routed or given a direct further along the route if needed due to traffic.
List of Charleston SIDs:
| Departure | Direction | Exit Fix |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| LGRHD3    | South     | GIPPL    |
| MLTRE2    | Northwest | VAN      |
| MLTRE2    | North     | JYMSE    |
| PLMTO3    | Norhteast | CRE      |
| STUNO1    | Northwest | IRQ      |
| STUNO1    | West      | ALD      |
| STUNO1    | Southwest | DBN      |
| SWPFX2    | North     | FILLI    |


# Charleston STARs
Charleston uses RNAV arrivals, which means aircrat will descend via the arrival and you should not need to descend aircraft unless needed due to other traffic.
Arrivals once they have reached the end of the STAR they will fly a heading which helps the controller set them up for the approach.
You can take aircraft off the arrival early if needed to vector, (commonly happens when trying to sequence many aircraft into a singular runway.)
