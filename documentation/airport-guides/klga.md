### About this facility
New York TRACON (N90), Westbury, New York, USA
1,416,240 annual operations in 2021 (<a href="https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tracon.asp" target="_blank">FAA ATADS</a>)

### Airspace
Widely considered to be the most complex airspace in the world, the New York TRACON (N90) includes three major airports: KJFK, KEWR, and KLGA. Combined, they accumulated 1.29 million aircraft movements in 2019, and an additional 667,000 movements from various New York area satellite airports. With only 9 miles and 14 miles separating KLGA from KJFK and KEWR (respectively), these powerhouse airports are extremely close together, making simultaneous operations with changing runway configurations and countless crossing flows highly difficult.

### Sectors Available in openScope
N90 includes 5 different areas: Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark, Islip, and Liberty. In this case, we are only simulating the LaGuardia area, operating as the HAARP sector, with all other LaGuardia sectors combined at HAARP.

```
V - HAARP (default)
F - Final Vector (unavailable)
Y - NYACK (unavailable)
D - EMPYR (unavailable)
X - NOBBI (unavailable)
L - departure (unavailable)
```
LaGuardia airport has 2 large airports in close proximity. Newark-Liberty Airport to the west, and Kennedy Airport to the east. This leaves very little room for vectoring and presents a unique challenge for the simulated controller. The default runway configuration is Depart 13, Land 22

### Vectoring Departures

All departures will need to be vectored to join their route. For this configuration, aircraft departing on the `LGA7` SID will be assigned either the Coney Climb or the Whitestone Climb depending on their exit gate.
