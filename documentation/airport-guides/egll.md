### About London Heathrow

Heathrow Airport (Also known as London Heathrow) (ICAO: EGLL, IATA: LHR) is the main and biggest airport in the United Kingdom, acting as the primary hub for British Airways (ICAO: BAW, callsign: SPEEDBIRD), and the primary operating airport for Virgin Atlantic (ICAO: VIR, callsign: VIRGIN). 

Heathrow Airport serves the majority of London air travel, as well as the majority of southern Britain. It is located 14 miles to the West of London's City Center. It is one of the 6 commercial airports which service London (along with City, Stansted, Luton, Southend and Gatwick).

Heathrow Airport was first built in 1929 as a small airfield in the hamlet of Heathrow. The development of Heathrow picked up pace in 1944 as a stopover location for long-distance military aircraft, however, by the time it neared completion, WW2 had already finished, so the British government continued to develop the airport for civil use. It was finally opened in 1946 as 'London Airport', and renamed to 'Heathrow Airport' in 1966.

### Airspace

The London TMA, being responsible for all of London's airports, covers an enormous area from Southampton to Chelmsford. For more information, check the [NATS website](http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=165&Itemid=3.html)

### Standard Operations

###### Runway usage

Heathrow Airport has two runways, 09L/27R and 09R/27L. All four runway approaches are certified for ILS operations, however, Heathrow commonly operates in so called Segregated Mode, meaning one runway is used for departures whilst the other is used for arrivals. Under Westerly operations (landing and departing off 27's), the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day. In easterly configuration, runway 09L is always the arriving runway, whilst 09R is the departing runway. Westerly operations are generally preferred for noise abatement.

### Instrument Procedures

###### Departures

Departing aircraft follow their assigned SID climbing to 6000ft until cleared to a higher altitude. The SIDs do not bring aircraft outside the TMA, they instead link up with a complicated network of airways that connects the UK to Europe and the rest of the world.

###### Arrivals

All of Heathrow's STARs bring aircraft to one of 4 VORs where aircraft must hold. These are BNN (Bovingdon), BIG (Biggin), LAM (Lambourne) and OCK (Ockham). From there, aircraft are vectored onto the ILS, sometimes with separation as small as 2.5nm.
