### About this facility
The San Jose airport in the NorCal TRACON (NCT), Northern California, US had 234,701 movements in 2019 ([FAA ATADS](https://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/Tracon.asp)).

### Airspace
The NorCal TRACON extends accross much of Northern California, providing service to the San Francisco Bay Area and its surrounding regions.
NCT typically controls up to 19,000 feet.

NorCal TRACON's major airport is the San Francisco International airport, and also serves several medium-sized class C airports such as San Jose International.

### Instrument procedures
San Jose has a mixture of RNAV and non-RNAV departure procedures. Most of these require radar vectors from ATC.
San Jose's RNAV STARs are highly automated with numerous speed and altitude restrictions to manage descents.
ILS and visual approaches are most common at San Jose, although the airport has several RNAV (GPS and RNP) approaches, as well as a charted visual approach procedure.

### Airports of interest
#### San Jose Norman Y Mineta International SJC
San Jose, while not NCT's major airport, is a moderately busy airport that mainly serves airports in the western United States.
Its top domestic destinations include Los Angeles, San Diego, and Seattle.
Internationally, San Jose operators mainly fly to Mexico and Canada.
The San Jose runway configuration follows the one at nearby SFO. When SFO is in its west flow, so is SJC. When SFO is in east, so is SJC.
San Jose uses the west-facing runways the most. 30R is typically used for departures as it's closer to the ramp.

#### San Francisco International SFO
*20 nmi northwest of SJC*

SFO is NCT's busiest airport, and one of the busiest in the state. San Francisco is a major pit-stop for many international routes crossing the Pacific.
Due to the high concentration of airports in the San Francisco Bay Area, SFO's class B airspace is designed to accomodate traffic from SJC, OAK, and nearby GA airports.
SFO arrivals usually make their approach over the San Francisco Bay, so SJC departures need to be spaced properly.

#### Oakland International OAK
*25 nmi northwest of SJC*

Oakland handles a similar amount of traffic as San Jose, and is divided into two complexes. GA aircraft fly regularly in the area.

#### San Carlos SQL
*17 nmi northwest of SJC*

A popular GA hub with a flight school, FBOs, and the Hiller air museum. The SFO class B airspace was modified in the 2010s to accomodate GA traffic in the region, mostly from SQL.

#### Moffett Federal Airfield NUQ
*7 nmi northwest of SJC*

Home to the NASA Ames Research Center.
